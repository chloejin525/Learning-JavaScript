Here are all the projects/exercise programs I've done while learning JavaScript:

1. Pig Game: see the js file for game rules
2. Quiz Game: use the console to display questions and score; and use the prompt function to input answers. 
3. Deep Equal: see the js file for description
4. Mouse Trail: a series of dots that would follow the mouse pointer as you moved it across the page
5. Tab Effects: Write a function, asTabs, that takes a DOM node and creates a tabbed interface showing the child elements of that node. It should insert a list of <button> elements at the top of the node, one for each child element, containing text retrieved from the data-tabname attribute of the child. All but one of the original children should be hidden (given a display style of none), and the currently visible node can be selected by clicking the buttons.
6. Autocompletion: Extend a text field so that when the user types, a list of suggested values is shown below the field. You have an array of possible values available and should show those that start with the text that was typed. When a suggestion is clicked, replace the text fieldâ€™s current value with it.
