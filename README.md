Here are all the projects/exercise programs I've done while learning JavaScript:

1. Pig Game: see the js file for game rules
2. Quiz Game: use the console to display questions and score; and use the prompt function to input answers. 
3. Deep Equal: see the js file for description
4. Mouse Trail: a series of dots that would follow the mouse pointer as you moved it across the page
